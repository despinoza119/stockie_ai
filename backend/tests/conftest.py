"""
Description: Shared pytest fixtures for all test modules.
             Provides a synchronous TestClient (for simple endpoint tests)
             and an async HTTPX client (for tests that need async semantics).
             Import these by adding the fixture name as a function parameter —
             pytest resolves them automatically.
