# Stockie AI — Task Plan (Living Document)

Companion to [`PLANNING_features.md`](./PLANNING_features.md). This is the working backlog. **Edit it.** Tick boxes as we complete tasks, append to the Decision Log when we change direction, add to the Risks section when we hit something unexpected.

---

## 0. How to use this file

- **Checkboxes** (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) are the source of truth for progress. Don't delete completed tasks; we want the history.
- **Owners** are tagged inline: `@bvela` (backend) or `@despinoza` (frontend). `@both` means we pair on it.
- **Statuses** beyond checkbox: add `(WIP)`, `(BLOCKED: reason)`, or `(DEFERRED: reason)` after a task when relevant.
- **Adding tasks**: append to the current sprint or to the backlog at the bottom. Don't rewrite history.
- **When a sprint ends**: write a 2-3 line retro under that sprint's "Retro" subsection. What shipped, what slipped, what to change.
- **When we change a major decision**: log it in section 7 with a date. Don't just edit and forget.

## 1. Locked-in decisions (from feature-planning review)

| #   | Decision                                                                                                          | Rationale                                                                               |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D1  | **Launch market: US equities + ETFs first.** BVL ships in v1.1.                                                   | Data availability and tooling maturity. BVL is differentiator, not blocker.             |
| D2  | **Single tier during build; no monetization work.**                                                               | Skip Stripe, billing, paid-tier gating until we have users.                             |
| D3  | **LLM API dependency is acceptable.**                                                                             | Use OpenAI/Anthropic for sentiment scoring and chat assistant when those features land. |
| D4  | **Rules-based recommendation engine for MVP.** ML/LLM scoring is post-MVP.                                        | Transparency, regulatory safety, lower delivery risk.                                   |
| D5  | **Backend/frontend split:** `@bvela` owns Python/FastAPI/data/scoring; `@despinoza` owns Next.js/React/charts/UX. | Plays to existing strengths.                                                            |
| D6  | **Cadence: 2-week sprints, ~10 hrs/week each (~40 hrs per sprint combined).** MVP target ≈ 5 months / 10 sprints. | Realistic part-time pace.                                                               |
| D7  | **Python 3.12 + FastAPI + Postgres/TimescaleDB + Redis + Next.js + TypeScript.**                                  | See PLANNING_features.md §5.                                                            |

## 2. Project conventions

- **Repo layout** (assumed; revisit in Sprint 0):
  ```
  stockie_ai/
    backend/        # FastAPI app, services, models, repositories
      app/
        api/        # FastAPI routers
        services/   # business logic
        models/     # SQLAlchemy / Pydantic
        repositories/
        data_providers/  # provider abstractions (yfinance, Polygon, ...)
        scoring/    # fundamental, technical, sentiment, macro, recommendation
        workers/    # Celery tasks
        core/       # config, db, security
      tests/
    frontend/       # Next.js app
      app/
      components/
      lib/
    infra/          # docker-compose, deploy configs
    PLANNING_features.md
    PLANNING_tasks.md   # this file
    CLAUDE.md
  ```
- **Branches:**
  - `main` — always deployable; no direct pushes.
  - `feat/<short-desc>` — new features (e.g. `feat/ticker-search`).
  - `fix/<short-desc>` — bug fixes (e.g. `fix/health-timestamp-tz`).
  - `chore/<short-desc>` — tooling, deps, config (e.g. `chore/upgrade-ruff`).
  - `docs/<short-desc>` — documentation-only changes.
  - Keep names lowercase, hyphen-separated, ≤ 40 characters.
  - Open a PR against `main`; the other person reviews before merge.
- **Commits:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
- **Issues:** Use the GitHub issue templates (bug report / feature request). Link issues to PRs with `Closes #<n>`.
- **PRs:** Use the PR template. CI must be green before merge. Squash-merge preferred to keep `main` history clean.
- **Definition of Done** (every task):
  1. Code merged to `main` via reviewed PR.
  2. Passing tests where applicable (unit for backend logic, component/e2e for frontend flows).
  3. File headers updated per `CLAUDE.md` (every file we touch).
  4. Public functions/components have docstrings/JSDoc.
  5. No secrets in code; new env vars added to `.env.example` and documented.
  6. If user-facing: works on desktop Chrome at minimum, basic responsive check.

## 4. Sprint backlog

> Each sprint is two weeks. Owners are placeholders — swap freely. Don't be precious about scope; if something slips, move it to the next sprint and log it in the retro.

### Sprint 0 — Scaffolding (Weeks 1–2)

**Goal:** Both of us can run the full stack locally and push to a shared repo. No business logic yet.

- [x] `@bvela` Create GitHub repo, add `CLAUDE.md`, `PLANNING_features.md`, `PLANNING_tasks.md`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`.
- [x] `@bvela` Initialize FastAPI project with Poetry/uv, Pydantic Settings, `/health` endpoint, structured logging.
- [x] `@bvela` Add `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres + TimescaleDB extension + Redis.
- [x] `@bvela` Configure Alembic migrations; create an empty initial migration.
- [x] `@bvela` Set up pre-commit (ruff + black + mypy) and pytest skeleton.
- [x] `@despinoza` Initialize Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind project.
- [x] `@despinoza` Set up ESLint + Prettier + a basic component library (shadcn/ui or similar).
- [x] `@despinoza` Wire a typed API client (e.g. `openapi-typescript`) consuming FastAPI's `/openapi.json`.
- [x] `@despinoza` Build placeholder landing page that calls `/health` and renders the response.
- [x] `@both` GitHub Actions CI: lint + tests on every PR, both backend and frontend.
- [x] `@both` Decide on issue/PR template and branch naming. Document under §2.
- [x] `@both` Pair session: end-to-end smoke (`docker compose up` → both services reachable, frontend reads from backend).

**Retro (fill at end of sprint):**

> _What shipped:_
> _What slipped:_
> _What to change:_

---

### Sprint 1 — Data provider abstractions + ticker resolution (Weeks 3–4)

- [ ] `@despinoza` Macro dashboard page (US): rate curve, CPI/GDP trends, key indices.
- [ ] `@despinoza` Sector heatmap component on landing page.
- [ ] `@both` Decide LLM provider for sentiment fallback (Anthropic vs OpenAI) and how to budget cost. Log under §7.

**Retro:**

> _What shipped:_ _What slipped:_ _What to change:_

### Sprint 6 — Recommendation engine + ticker page assembly (Weeks 13–14)

**Goal:** Every ticker has a recommendation card showing short/mid/long-term verdicts with explanations and the four sub-scores. Ticker page is feature-complete for MVP.

- [ ] `@bvela` `scoring/recommendation.py`: combines Fundamental/Technical/Sentiment/Macro into per-horizon verdicts.
- [ ] `@bvela` Horizon-specific weight tables (configurable, version-controlled). Long-term leans fundamental, short-term leans technical+sentiment.
- [ ] `@bvela` Plain-language explanation generator (template-based; LLM polishing optional).
- [ ] `@bvela` `/tickers/{symbol}/recommendation` endpoint returning all three horizons + confidence + disclaimer text.

- [ ] `@despinoza` Recommendation card component (top of ticker page): three horizon chips, action, confidence, sub-scores, explanation, disclaimer.
- [ ] `@despinoza` Ticker detail page final layout: header + recommendation card + four tabs (Fundamental, Technical, News/Sentiment, Macro context).
- [ ] `@despinoza` Empty/loading/error states across all modules.
- [ ] `@both` Code review pass on the entire scoring pipeline.

**Retro:**

> _What shipped:_ _What slipped:_ _What to change:_

- [ ] `@despinoza` Dark mode polish; loading skeletons everywhere; error toasts.
- [ ] `@despinoza` Playwright e2e tests for the critical flows: sign up → add watchlist → view recommendation → set alert.
- [ ] `@despinoza` Accessibility pass (keyboard nav, contrast, labels).
- [ ] `@both` Bug bash: each of us spends a full session trying to break the other's work.

**Retro:**

## 6. Risks & blockers (running log)

| Date       | Risk / Blocker                                                            | Severity | Owner  | Mitigation / status                                                                                              |

## 7. Decision log

> Append; never delete. Use ISO dates.

- **2026-05-21** — Approved feature plan (PLANNING_features.md). Locked decisions D1–D7 above.
- **2026-05-21** — Backend = bvela, frontend = despinoza. Either may pair on the other's area for hard parts (recommendation engine, BVL ingestion).
- **YYYY-MM-DD** — _Template: brief decision, rationale, who approved._

---

## 8. Pending questions

Things we deferred from the feature-planning round; revisit at the milestone listed.

- [ ] **Hosting & budget** (revisit before Sprint 9 deploy).
- [ ] **BVL data approach**: scrape vs. paid vendor (revisit during Sprint 10 spike).
- [ ] **Monetization model** (revisit after v1.0 launch and ~1 month of usage data).
- [ ] **Self-hostable vs. cloud-LLM** strategy (revisit before chat-assistant work begins post-MVP).
- [ ] **ToS / Privacy Policy** drafting — must be done before Sprint 9 beta.
